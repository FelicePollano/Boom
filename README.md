## Note for developers
After lightmap introduction, some levels can complain about a missing dependency. This is due to the reasonable limitation Github imposes to file sizes. Just ignore this, and re-bake locally for the interested levels the Lightmaps, see screenshot below:

For non godot developers, [godot 3.5.1](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.5.1/Godot_v3.5.1-stable_win64.exe.zip) is needed, It could possibly work with other 3.x.x versions. It comes with a single launchable files in both Windows and Linux and Mac systems. After cloning the project, just "Scan" the folder containing the clone with Godot project explorer and open or run it.
